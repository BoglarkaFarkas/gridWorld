# gridWorld

The optimal solution to the grid world problem outlined in the Reinforcement Learning book, implemented in Haskell programming language. The grid size can be changed, but it is set to 5x5 by default.   
Since each position is updated immediately, 15 iterations are sufficient to reach the optimal solution. Setting the number of iterations higher won't result in significant changes. Therefore, we obtain the optimal solution after 15 iterations.   
In the following image, we can see the result of the 5x5 grid based on the rules outlined in the book:
